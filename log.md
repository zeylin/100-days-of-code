# 100 Days Of Code - Journal

### Day 1: September 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finally got around to start this! As part of the daily challenge obligations, did a quick round of Java interview questions to freshen up memory (and just get started on something).

**Thoughts:** Starting the 100 days of code challenge ðŸŽ‰ Or really, just a way to get to code more consistently, and organize my learning. Planning to dive in into my main language and platform of choice (Java and Spring), continue on frontend, and who knows what elseâ€”only impromptu browsing can tell!

### Day 2: September 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Resumed working on a small personal project again. Adding unit tests with testcontainers which I'm using for the first time, and which is why I wanted to do some testing with that library.

**Thoughts:** Took a bit of a break from the 100 days routine. I guess, personally, the most important part is just doing it, at whatever pace when life happens. As for the coding part of thoughts of the day, so far enjoying running tests with testcontainers; makes testing with postgres much easier.
