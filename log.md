# 100 Days Of Code - Journal

### Day 1: September 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finally got around to start this! As part of the daily challenge obligations, did a quick round of Java interview questions to freshen up memory (and just get started on something).

**Thoughts:** Starting the 100 days of code challenge ðŸŽ‰ Or really, just a way to get to code more consistently, and organize my learning. Planning to dive in into my main language and platform of choice (Java and Spring), continue on frontend, and who knows what elseâ€”only impromptu browsing can tell!

### Day 2: September 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Resumed working on a small personal project again. Adding unit tests with testcontainers which I'm using for the first time, and which is why I wanted to do some testing with that library.

**Thoughts:** Took a bit of a break from the 100 days routine. I guess, personally, the most important part is just doing it, at whatever pace when life happens. As for the coding part of thoughts of the day, so far enjoying running tests with testcontainers; makes testing with postgres much easier.

### Day 3: September 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Adding some light new features, such as dictionaries API, and unit tests. Looked into adding some validation using `javax.validation` API; however for now, the project doesn't seem to benefit from it, as validations already in place are not checking simple singular fields. Which got me thinking of factoring out validation logic, as it really seem to blur with the rest of the service application code (which I'll look into more later, and maybe the Java validation library will still be of use).

**Thoughts:** I find that aside from the obvious puprose of testing to ensure correctness and expected output of code, it also gives a sense of security and certainty in knowing that changes and new additions are at least being monitored by an additional pair of eyes, figuratively speaking. So it's a good way not to just add checks and balances, but also add more confidence in your work. Also, I find writing tests is also a nice change of things, like shifting more focus to the what, and thus to what overall goals you as a programmer, and your program, are aiming to achieve.
