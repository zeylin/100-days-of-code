# 100 Days Of Code - Journal

### Day 1: September 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finally got around to start this! As part of the daily challenge obligations, did a quick round of Java interview questions to freshen up memory (and just get started on something).

**Thoughts:** Starting the 100 days of code challenge ðŸŽ‰ Or really, just a way to get to code more consistently, and organize my learning. Planning to dive in into my main language and platform of choice (Java and Spring), continue on frontend, and who knows what elseâ€”only impromptu browsing can tell!
